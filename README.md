# TrafficAccidentAnalysis
Due to the large number of accidents happening in New York City, we investigate the reasons for the same and propose certain steps that can be taken in order to reduce the number of accidents.

We used the "NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions" and the "Traffic Tickets Issued: Four Year Window" datasets for our project and we analysed them in the following ways:
1. Data Visualization
2. Training a Bayes classifier
3. Clustering using DBSCAN
